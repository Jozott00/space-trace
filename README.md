## Getting started

Setup your development environments.

Install Python3.8 or higher, zbar, popper, libxml2

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=space_trace FLASK_ENV=development
```

Create the database file with:

```
$ python
>>> from space_trace import db
>>> db.create_all()
```

Start the server with

```
flask run
```

This launces a simple webserver which can only be accessed from the localhost.

**Note:** Don't use this server in production, it is insecure and low
performance.

## Deployment

How we deploy this app on Ubuntu.

Install the requirements with:

```bash
sudo apt -y install python3-venv python3-pip libzbar0 libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libxmlsec1-openssl poppler-utils
```

Create a virtual env with:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Create the database file with:

```
$ python
>>> from space_trace import db
>>> db.create_all()
```

Copy `instance/config_example.toml` to `instance/config.toml` and edit all
the fields in it.

Open `space-trace.service` and edit the username and all paths to the working
directory.

Start the systemd service with:

```bash
sudo cp space-trace.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable space-trace.service
sudo systemctl start space-trace.service
```

The service should now be up and running ðŸŽ‰

To stop the service run:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop space-trace.service
```

To update the service to a new version (commit) run:

```bash
git pull
sudo systemctl restart space-trace.service
```

## Development

- Use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to format code
- Try to follow the python style guide [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Roadmap

### Alpha 1

- [x] Decode a EU Certificate

### Alpha 2

- [x] Login with SAML
- [x] Upload Picture of QR Code (no verification)
- [x] Register for a day
- [ ] Export contacts on day basis

### Beta

- [x] Allow PDF upload
- [ ] Allow taking pictures from the browser
- [x] Verify Certificates
- [ ] Admin interface

### Final Release

- [ ] Smart export (by selecting infected member not dates)
- [ ] public & private APIs so other services can integrate
- [ ] Tests and CI Pipeline to check on every commit
- [ ] statically type all function and add mypy to CI
